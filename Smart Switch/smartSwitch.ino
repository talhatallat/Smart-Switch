  Program Name: Smart Switch using ESP8266 
  Programers NameS: TALHA TALLAT and BADER AL MUSKARI
  Decripition: This program allows user to connect wifi module NodeMCU (ESP8266) to the wifi to control any 

               electrincs device using the BLYNK Application on any smart phone or tablets from any where

               in the world.

               BLYNK ?!!!!!!!    

               Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the 

               linkes over the Internet. You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your projects by

               simply dragging and dropping widgets.


  This is the link for the library that we used  https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest 

  Blynk library is licensed under MIT license

  This example code is in public domain.

  This example runs directly on NodeMCU.



  Note: This requires ESP8266 support package:
