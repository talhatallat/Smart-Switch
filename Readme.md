# Smart Switch Using Esp8266 

****The program description:****

This program allows users to connect the wifi module NodeMCU (ESP8266) to the wifi to control any electronic output devices (240V bulb in this case) using the BLYNK Application on any smartphone or tablet from anywhere in the world.

Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the linkes over the Internet. You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

****Real-world problem:****

Humans nowadays consume a lot of earth resources in vain. Many people don’t care about the next generation and what will be left for them. Overconsuming must stop and the glasses guys team decided to fix it. People are using a lot of electricity by overcharging their phones at night and letting something on for good while such as room lights and other electronic devices due to people laziness. They leave output load on for good while and consume a lot of power and which can be costly and could be dangerous and the team idea fixes all that problem with our device that we built.  

****Solution:****

Based on this idea, the team came up with a device that will reduce electricity consumption and save money for the people who use it. Nowadays almost everyone spends a lot of time using their mobile phone and based on that building a smart switch that can be controlled over the internet using our smartphones. Which provides users with control in their hands and allows them to switch ON or switch OFF the bulb.

****Blynk Interface:****

Nowadays people can’t live without the smartphone. That’s why the phone was decided to be used in this project which allows users to turn on the light of the room and off with their smartphone. It is an extremely simple way of connecting the device to the home WIFI and uses the BLYNK application to control the lights by adding the button widgets to the phone screen. this makes it much easier to control rather than opening the application. The screenshots of the BLYNK application and the phones widgets are shown below.

Down below is the home screen of the phone which includes two widgets buttons

The second real-world problem that the team solved of people who charge their phone overnight is not recommended at all because overcharging could damage the battery of the phone and the main thing it could cause explosions. The glasses guys team fixes this problem by using the BLYNK application to set up a timer for turning the power on to charge the phone for some time and by setting time off for turning the power off. The timer feature can be used for housing heating, water boiler, lighting and other power sources. 

****Circuit Design:****

The rough diagram of the circuit was drawn on a page and then physically built with components.
